## Clearing out the Temple
With the help of Theodore and Willem, the group is able to clear out a path to a caved in room.  This room has a large green glow to it.  Kal looks around the room and sees a statue with a necklace of some sort of evocation magic.  He seriously investigates (rolling a 3) and determines that the largest emerald he has ever seen is just laying there to be taken.  He attempted to pick it up and was hit with a fireball.  After nearly passing out, he picks up the [Necklace of Fireball](/docs/items#Necklace-of-Fireballs)

The group looks around some more, but it appears everything else is just secret tunnels going back to the main chambers.  After discussing with Willem and Theodore, Nib and Kal escort them back to Phandalin to speak with Gundrin.

## Returning to Phandalin
Upon arriving back in town, the group met with Gundrin in his rooms.  There the two dwarves told the story of what happened:
* They had just cleared into the temple area and were taking their resting shifts.
* It was Nundro's shift and the woke up to noises.  They saw to Drow and a spider man thing walk into the Temple like they were waiting for it be cleared out.
* They came back out soon after and Nundro called out in challenge.  Nundro was quickly overtaken and hauled away with the invadors.
* They continue to talk about everything else that happened.

Gundrin decides it would be best to head straight to the Wave Echo Cave in the morning.

In the morning, Kal ate with Gundrin, Darren and Sildar.  Kal let them (Darren and Sildar) know about the encounter with the Orcs and them fleeing from a White dragon.  Kal picked up some healing potions and then soon left town with Gundrin, Nib and Siri.

## Wave Echo Cave
The group made good time to the cave.  It had been some months since Gundrin was last here.  As they made their way into the entryway, the group discovered Thardin's corpse.  He had been dead for about a week, according to Nib.  After a brief bit of mourning, Gundrin decides to continue.  He asked that someone take Thardin's boots should anything ill befall him.

The group investigated the western portion of the cave.  They encountered another goo jelly thing which nearly killed Kal.  Nib stepped in with a timely Sacred Flame to end the fight.

Kal and Nib attempted to rest quickly, however they started to hear voices.  Instead of resting, Kal and Nib used a potion and some lay on hands to get ready to fight.  Kal followed the sound of the voices and eventually found them in an interior room, where three bugbear's attacked.
