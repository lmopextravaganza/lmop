## Backstory:

Down on his luck and without any prospects in Neverwinter, Kal Windrunner looked up a dwarf by the name of Gundrin Rockseeker for an escort job from Neverwinter to some woodtick down in the south called Phandalin.  Gundrin also had hired an old drunk by the name of Pete and a halfling healer named Nib.  In addition, a member of the Lord's Alliance, Sildar Hallwinter would ride south with them as well.

## Evermist, Part I
After a day of slow travel on the road, Sildar and Gundrin went ahead of the group to travel to Phandalin at a quicker pace than the oxen would allow.  The group proceeded south, encountering a group from a town down the road who was heading to Neverwinter, as their town had been attacked by Goblins and burned.  When Kal, Nib and Pete arrived in Neverwinter, they heard that the blacksmith's daughter had been taken by Goblins.

Kal and his groups met with other members of the Lord's Alliance and went back into the woods with their local commander to find the little girl.  The path took them into the Neverwinter Woods, eventually finding the hideout where the goblins were located.  The group quickly dispatched of the sentries and made their way into the a crypt.  There additional goblins were combatted and killed.  Finally, the group found the last room with a hobgoblin and several other goblins.  The other goblins were going throught a ritual sacrafice of the young child.  The group was able to kill the goblins, save the child, and take the Hobgoblin hostage.

Kal and the commander questioned the Hobgoblin and found out that he was supposed to be watching the road for a dwarf traveling south from Neverwinter and capture him, however the goblins disobeyed the hobgoblin's orders.  Several intimitdation checks later, the Hobgoblin provided a map of the area and stated that the black spider had sent them, then clammed up.  The child was returned to the blacksmith and the Hobgoblin was brought back to the Lord's Alliance tower for further questioning and future execution.  Nib gathered the ritual casting gear and a wand we later found out was a Wand of Eldrich Blaster.

## Evermist, Part II
As part of questioning the Hobgoblin, they found out that there was some sort of hidden undead off of the crypt.  Kal, Nib and Pete went back to the crypts, found the hidden entrance, then were attacked by several undead wraiths.  There we put to a final rest and the group found an elven blade of high quality (The Horde Sword).  The group then returned to Evermist and started to head south down the road to head to Phandalin.  As they headed south, the group noticed two large flying figures -- they appeared to be two dragons between the ruins of Thundertree and Neverwinter.

## On the road again, off the road again
While on the road to the south, the group encountered two dead horses which looked familiar to Gundrin and Sildar's horses.  While investigating the horses, the group was set upon by Goblins.  They were able to defend themselves and kill several goblins, while several others got away to the south.  While looking around the countryside, they found a Goblin path heading to the north.  They proceeded to follow it up until they found a cave.

## Cragmaw Cave/Hideout
Upon entering the cave, they encountered several wolves on chains.  After killing one, the group backed off as the goblins nearby seem to think it was just the wolves fighting.  The group then went up the west side and jumped up a high incline.  They made some noise and a goblin attacked and then attempted to run away.  Siri was able to run down the goblin before it was able to get away.  They then encountered a large group of goblins, including a goblin leader.  The Goblin Leader was going to execute Sildar infront of the group, however some well timed shots from Pete and Kal charging in was able to prevent the worst from happened.  Eventually the goblins were defeated and put the sword, however it did tire out the group.  Nib recovered a wand from the leader, which we found to be a Wand of Burning Hands.

After completing a short rest, the group moved through the rest of the cave.  Here they encountered more goblins and Bugbear named Klarg.  Klarg never had a chance to say anything, as even Sildar wiffing on both of his attacks, Kal, Pete and Nib were able to finish off Klarg. One goblin escaped, however Sildar was saved and a large cache of Lionshield Coster goods were found.

## Sweet Home...Phandalin?
The group, plus Sildar had an uneventful travel on the road to Phandalin.  Kal and team were able to drop off the cart at Barthen's Provisions.  It was first here that we heard about the Redbrands causing trouble in town.  Sildar rented the group rooms at the Stonehill inn as thanks for a night.  Nib and Kal went to the Lionshield Coster to let the person running it know where the goods are.  Kal met Miss Linene Graywind, a female elf who runs the shop.  While Barthen described her as a snob and hard to work with, Linene seemed pleased with the information Kal provided and promised a reward and her favor should this pan out.

Kal and Nib then headed to Nib's sisters house (Quill).  After meeting Quill and having some lunch, it was discovered that the Redbrands in town had killed a war buddy from Kal's army days, Tucks Dendar.  Quill provides some information that the town master (Harbin Wester) hired the Redbrands for protection but they seem to be extorting money out of people.  Tucks' wife and child have also not been seen since the murder.  Talk went back to news from the road and talk of dragons.  Nib and Kal let Quill know that there do seem to be two dragons flying from the Neverwinter Woods.  This caused Quill to be concerned.

Quill also had a favor to ask of Nib and Kal.  There is an alchemist who lives south of town several hours away.  Given the dragons flying around, she asked if we could go get the old lady alchemist from her house.  Nib and Kal left town and arrived at the home to discover a wounded Manticore attacking the house.  The group was able to communicate with it and provide it with some healing and food, and the Manticore (Brian) told them that he and his kind were attacked and had to flee from their homeland by a White Dragon to the south named Kryovain.

## The Redbrand Threat
After arriving back in Phandalin, Nib and Kal dropped off the alchemist and Quills house and went back to rest for the night.  The next morning they headed out to Darren Edermath's orchard, as Kal recalled stories from Tucks regarding Darren's checkered past as an adventuer.  Kal found out more about the Redbrands attempting to extort town members.  Darren also dropped a bunch of knowledge regarding Phandalin's history and the Lost Mine of Phandelver.  He proceeded to freak out Kal about him becoming a dragon slayer in the future.  On the bright side, he did offer Kal a piece of his adventuring gear, a helm that will allow Kal to see in the dark.

After leaving Darren's, Kal returned to the inn to discover Sildar waiting for him.  Sildar attempted to speak to the town master and was rebuffed.  In addition, the information he was able to gather regarding the Redbrands was not promising.  Sildar offerred 500g to Kal and Nib if they could take care of the Redbrand threat in the city.  Sildar also had not heard anything about the missing Lord's Alliance member he was looking for:  Iarno Albreck.

## Attack on the Redbrand Hideout
Nib, Siri and Kal were shown a way to the hideout from Quill's son (Carp).  From there, they made their way through the woods and were able to ambush three Redbrands lolling around as centry.  As they entered in the cave under the old manor house, Kal immediately was being psychicly probed by as Nothig.  After some back and forth bantering between Nothig and Kal, Kal jumped down and with a holy critical, one shot the beast to death.  Here he found some spell scrolls, jewels, and a hammer that started yelling as soon as he touched it.  He stowed it for now and continued on.

The group encountered a room with three bugbears and a goblin.  The goblin fainted and the bugbears attacked.  While the group did take some damage, they remained victorious.  They then spoke with the Goblin, whos name was Droop and wer able to gather more information.  The Glasstaff is a Redbrand mage who was working for the Black Spider, who appears to be an elf (drow?)  The elf was using the Cragmaw Goblins to reinforce the Redbrands to keep Phandalin under control.  The Goblin Kings sent the bugbears and Droop to reinforce the town.  Given Droop's information sharing, the team sent him outside and freed him.

Nib, Siri and Kal continued on, encountering 4 more Redbands which they dispatched of quickly.  Droop came back offering to help, so Kal and Nib let him follow them.  They then went into another room which they discovered to be a wizard's work room.  Siri attacked a small rodent which turned out to be a familiar.  They then heard noise from a fake door and started to chase down the person who was running.  They were finally able to catch up in a crypt room, which they encountered 3 undead wraiths, the Glassstaff and a redbrand.  After getting magic missiled repeatedly, Kal was able to kill the Glassstaff and help his friends finish off the other threats.

Kal decided it was important to ensure the building was secure. He went through the rest of the building, falling into a trap he knew was there do to some very poor jumping, and then finding two defenseless Redbrands who were sleeping and subsequently were butchered and killed.

With the area secure, Droop was able to unlock the prisoner's here (Tucks' family) and then smuggle them back out to Quills house.  While going over the items they discovered from the Wizard's quarters, it was discovered that the Glasstaff was actually Iarno Albreck -- the Lord's Alliance member that Sildar was looking for.  The documents make it seem like he was working directly for the Black Spider.

## Finishing the Redbrand Threat
Exhausted from the fight after having expending all of their resources, Nib and Kal decided it would be best to remove the rest of the Redbrands from Phandalin.  Given their current state, they went to seek assistance from Sildar.  Sildar was hesistent to assist, but after some convincing, decided to join the group.  Kal was questioning Sildar's waryness given he was paying them to remove the Redbrands.  Siri was growling at Sildar, which made Kal's mind up.  Kal attacked Sildar and after a bit, Nib also joined in.  They were able to knock out Sildar and once that happened, he morphed into a blue humanoid creature.  Kal and Nib had never seen anything like that.  Kal went back to the inn and found that Sildar had been attacked and was being held captive.  Kal freed Sildar and they proceded to the Sleeping Giant Inn, where the Redbrands had been staying.

Upon arriving, a scuffle occurred with three Redbrands hanging around outside of the building.  The fight lead to the inside where all but on of the Redbrands were put to the sword.  Kal had a slight disagreement with the Bar owner, however Sildar stepped in to smooth things over.  They took the one Redbrand captive.  After discussing where to keep the Redbrand and the blue man, they decided to move them into the cells under the Tresendar Manor.  Droop and Sildar stayed to keep watch while Nib, Siri and Kal took a rest.

After the rest, Kal went through the hideout looking for any arcane or magical objects.  After searching the building, Kal found a platinum signet ring which had not been discovered before.  Kal then rejoined Droop and Sildar and they questioned the blue man (doppleganger).  They found out a bit more about the Black Spider (was sending people here to get the town in order and help the Glassstaff).  The Doppleganger started to do some mental trickery with Sildar.  After a brief discussion about how to properly hold someone like this, Sildar and Kal executed the Doppleganger.

## Redbrand Aftermath
Nib and Kal shared the information they had recovered from the Tresendar mannor -- it appears that the Glasstaff was actually Iarno, with Sildar.  In addition, they shared the information that Droop was able to provide as well.  It appears that there are many parties involved with trying to shape how Phandalin will be controlled.

Sildar shares that he believes the townmaster needs to be removed and someone else needs to be put in charge.  They suggest that the next day they go to meet with Harbin Wester.

In the morning, Nib and Kal go back out to Darren's to see if he can help identify some of the magical items they found.  While Darren wasn't able to give specifics, they were able to get some historical information on some of the items, such as the hammer and the ring; both of which appear to have been wielded and lost by the former Lord Tresendar.

## Harbin Wester.
After returning to the Inn from Darren's, Nib, Siri and Kal join Sildar to go speak and receive Harbin Wester of control of the town.  Harbin is very confrontational.  Kal commanded Harbin outside, where he proceded to knock out Sildar in one atack.  Nib was able to revive him.  Siri went around the house to a side door and was able to get an opportunity attack and knock Harbin prone.  From there the group was able to attack and permanently subdue Harbin...who was a Doppleganger.  The group then searched the house and found the real Harbin Wester locked up in his own cellar.  After talking with Harbin, it sounds like he had been locked up for more than a month in his own cellar.  He was done with the town and done with being Townmaster.

## A New Phandalin
The next day Kal spoke with Sildar.  Given Harbin's soon to be departure from the Town Master role, Sildar was concerned about who should be the new Town Master.  He didn't want to lead as a town outsider.  Kal decided to poke around town and see what the prominent townsfolk thought.

* Barthen:  Would prefer if none of the business owners were Town Master -- do not want to have favortism in place.  Thought Darren would do an okay job as Townmaster.
* Linene:  Didn't seem interested in the job -- has enough to do with the Lionshield Coster.  Was happy to hear about more of her stolen goods being under the manner.  Gave favor to Kal for providing information and in addition gave some gold to him.
* Halia:  Thinks she should be the Town Master.  Offered to have friends look into the Black Spider people.  Nib was wary of here -- Halia has unsavory contacts with criminals from other towns.
* Toblen Stonehill -- Thinks that Darren would do a good job of being Town Master.
* Smithy -- Smitten with Kal for cleaning up the trash from town.  Thinks Kal or Darren should be town master.

Kal relayed this information to Sildar.  Sildar and Kal are both concerned with what happened to Gundrin and his brothers.  Sildar asks Kal and Nib to go to the 'Castle' that Droop described and see if Gundrin is being held there.  Sildar is going to stay in town and try to get things stabilized.

Kal meets with Tucks' family.  Tucks' wife has nothing to pay for Kal getting them out, however she does tell Kal about a family heirloom that is in the ruins of Thundertree.  It is Kals if he would like to go up there and get it.
