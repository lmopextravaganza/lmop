### Dwarvish Journal
Among the scraps of paper, notes and books is a tome written in Dwarvish. It says that it's the journal of an adventurer named Urmon, and it describes The Recorded Histories of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. Many of the pages have given way to time and whole sections are missing. 

What you are able to glean from the available text is this:
Approximately 350 years ago, The Phandelver's Pact was formed in the region that is now Phandalin and the Neverwinder Woods, on the Northern Sword Coast, when a long forgotten clan of Dwarves made an agreement with a group of Gnomes of unparalleled engineering skill to share ownership of a rich mine located in the Wave Echo Cave. The pact created a lot of wealth for the parties and the surrounding lands, drawing both admiration and envy. Later, a group of powerful Human wizards joined the agreement since the mine also contained strong magical energies and material, where a powerful new forge was crafted: the Forge of Spells. Powerful magical items were commissioned and created within. As the fame of the forge grew, the nearby settlement of Phandalin also prospered and attracted lots of attention.
Disaster struck, however, as Orcs swept the North, laying waste to all in their path. Reinforced by evil mercenary wizards, the orcs battled through the mines to seize its treasure and riches. Human wizards fought bravely alongside their Drawven and Gnomish allies to defend the Forge of Spells but to no avail. The ensuing battle was a grand one and much of the cavern was destroyed. Tremors and cave-ins meant heavy casualties and few, if any survived. Meanwhile, the original settlement of Phandalin was also wiped out by the Orcs and the mine was lost to the ages, as was all knowledge of the Phandelver Pact. 

In addition, Urman records that a magic Hammer named The Lightbringer was commissioned in honor of the God, Lathander, for a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. The mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver's Pact created such a weapon, but the hammer was lost when Sir Aldith died fighting off the orcs that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor
